**WARNING**: This distribution does not support Symfony 4. See the

that fits you best.

Welcome to the Symfony Standard Edition - a fully-functional Symfony
application that you can use as the skeleton for your new applications.

For details on how to download and get started with Symfony, see the

Deployment steps :

Deployment requires three folders :
* - api To host REST Calls to the backend of the application
* - www to host Web parts of the development
* - images : to host assets (product images)

Just clone this repo in the api and www folders then run :

* $/api/[path_to_composer] composer install
* $/www/[path_to_composer] composer install

to install required Symfony Packages

You have to build CLIENT parts of the web application, require NODE and NPM :

* $/www/web/npm i
* $/www/web/npm run webpack:dev

To build the "build" folder

Use any lesscss compiler to build CSS
